      <h2>Act 1: The Witches' Prophecy</h2>
      <p>You are Macbeth, a brave and loyal soldier in King Duncan's army. As you and your friend Banquo ride home from a battle, you encounter three witches who make a startling prophecy. They hail you as Thane of Glamis and Thane of Cawdor, and declare that you will become king one day. Banquo is skeptical, but you can't shake the feeling that there might be some truth to the witches' words.</p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
